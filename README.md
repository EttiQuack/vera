#Overview
Vera isn't just a project—it's a precaution. It's an interface, a relay, a fallback. Built to withstand pressure, obfuscate interaction, and provide fail-safes if things ever go sideways. Like now.

If you're reading this, either something's gone wrong... or you're Olive.
Hi, Olive.









### Organiser notes
Don't forget to use `$hint` in **Quigga** — *Abdalla*

This project wouldn't exist without you guys. Keep it `$quack` — *Mosab*

Thank you to:
- Abdalla
- Mosab
- Awab
- All the members of **ISS-Sudan**  
...who've helped me bring this event to life.

And of course, thank you to all the players for trying out this little project of mine. ~Amr
